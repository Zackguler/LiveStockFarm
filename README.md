A livestock farm raises cattle. Each cattle is attached an electronic device that constantly
monitors the location of the cattle. If the cattle exit the farm boundaries the farmer gets notified.
The location information stored in a single database on the farm.
For majority of cattle, information is sent to central receiver using Zigbee signals. The server only
accepts Zigbee signals. However, for a few cattle, we must place a different electronic device on
the cattle which only works using Bluetooth signals. The software on the server cannot be
modified.
There are two kinds of cattle: Dairy cattle, cattle which give milk and beef cattle. Two important
categories of cattle food are Carbohydrates and Protein. Each type of cattle has different feeding
constraints. Milk cattle get corn for carbohydrates and soybean as protein. The beef cattle get
wheat for carbohydrates and canola for protein.
The veterinary physician visits the farm in autumn and gives vaccination to every cattle against
seasonal diseases. In the spring the ministry of Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock visits
the farm and checks if every cattle has a plastic ear tag that contains a unique id of the cattle.
